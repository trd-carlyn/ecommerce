							<h2> Slim Form Factor</h2>
							<p>HP has recently released a laptop which may be one of the most
								impressive laptops on the market. Coming in at a meager 2.45 lbs.,
								the HP Spectre is not the lightest laptop available, but it is the
								thinnest at 0.41" thick. The design of the laptop itself is also
								impressive. The laptop's screen is not connected to the back edge
								like traditional laptops, instead the Spectre's screen is connected
								to the base by two gold hinges on either side of the laptop's base.
								The sleek look of the Spectre combined with its black and silver
								color design makes the Spectre something to behold.
